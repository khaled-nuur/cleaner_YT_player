### cleaner_YT_player
A CSS style to declutter Youtube player
---


Declutters YT player for uninterrupted viewing experience. Now you can pause to actually see the video, and you don't have to keep your mouse still at all times ðŸ˜Ž

Check the screenshots


This doesn't remove any important UI items, and is specially geared towards watching playlists in full screen, other views benefit too.
This barrows from 2 other styles here, and a few more adjustments by me.


## CHANGES:-


â˜‘ Hides shadows along top and bottom.

â˜‘ Removes the *watch later* & *share* buttons from top right

â˜‘ Removes *playlist icon* from top-left, and instead shows the number of videos watched vs. remaining.

â˜‘ Makes the video title smaller, to not cover a significant portion of the video.

â˜‘ Removes *scroll for more* button.![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28248852/219968000-8d631795-f76a-4936-bee9-c6c65f227fbd.png)
